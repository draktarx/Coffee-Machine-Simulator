<p>Java provides several types for <strong>integers</strong> and <strong>fractional</strong> numbers. These types are often used in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an arithmetic expression is a combination of values and arithmetic operators that are used to perform mathematical operations. | The arithmetic operators include binary operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as unary operators such as unary plus and unary minus. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression. The order of operation in arithmetic expressions follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity.">arithmetic expressions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Integer numbers</strong> (0, 1, 2, ...) are represented by the following four types: <code class="language-java">long</code>, ⁣<code class="language-java">int</code>, <code class="language-java">short</code>, and <code class="language-java">byte</code>(from the largest to the smallest). These types have different sizes and may represent different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/18021" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a range of values refers to a sequence of consecutive values between a lower and an upper boundary. | For instance, a range from 2 to 5 includes both 2 and 5. In the context of the provided text, a range is used to generate pseudorandom integers within a given interval. The range is represented as the length of the interval plus one, which allows generating any number within the range by shifting the interval to the value of the lower border. Additionally, a range can be stored in a wrapper class's special pool for reuse, which is useful for boxing or autoboxing.">ranges of values</a>.

The `int` type can store numbers within a smaller range, while `long` can store a wider range of numbers. Integer types can be used in various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Java also allows the use of the special underscore character to improve the readability of numbers by separating groups of digits.">integer type</a> is calculated as <span class="math-tex">\(−(2^{n−1})\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\((2^{n−1})−1\)</span>, where <em><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span></em> is the number of bits.

<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3517" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, floating-point types are data types that represent fractional numbers, which consist of an integer part, a fractional part, and a separator. | Java has two basic types for this purpose: float and double. However, they cannot represent all decimal numbers exactly due to the limited number of significant decimal digits they support (6-7 for float and 14-16 for double). In practice, programmers often use the double type, and it is recommended for code challenges. It is essential to pay attention to errors during computation and the use of the decimal separator when reading floating-point numbers.">Floating-point types</a></strong> represent numbers with fractional parts.

When assigning a value to a variable, you can use a decimal point to separate the integer and fractional parts of the number. If you specify too many or too few significant digits, an error may occur.

Reference types, on the other hand, are used to represent objects, and they are created using the keyword new. When a reference type is created, memory is allocated for the object, and it is called instantiation.
